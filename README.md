User-friendly interface for customers to view, book, and pay for tours
Secure authentication and session management
Automated email notifications for booking confirmations
Efficient error handling and data validation
Technologies:

Java (Backend)
JDBC for MySQL connectivity
MySQL (Database)
Java Swing (for UI) or web-based frontend
2. Folder Structure
Organize your project as follows:

/TourismManagement
    ├── /src
    │   ├── /models          # Models for customer, booking, and package
    │   ├── /controllers     # Business logic (e.g., booking, registration)
    │   ├── /views           # UI (Swing or HTML)
    │   └── /services        # Database services
    ├── /lib                 # External libraries (e.g., JDBC, Mail API)
    ├── /resources           # SQL scripts for database setup
    ├── README.md            # Project description
    ├── pom.xml              # Maven config (if using Maven)
    └── build.gradle         # Gradle config (if using Gradle)
3. SQL Script
Include an SQL script to set up the MySQL database in a /resources folder.

4. Main Code (Java)
Place all your Java code files in the /src folder, organized into appropriate subdirectories for models, services, controllers, and views.

5. Running Instructions
Provide clear instructions in the README.md for setting up and running the project:

How to Run:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tourism-management.git
Set up the MySQL database using the SQL script in /resources.
Update database credentials in the code.
